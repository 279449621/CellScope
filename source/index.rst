CellScope: High-Performance Cell Atlas Analysis with Tree-Structured Representation
======================================

CellScope is an efficient toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression data. 
It integrates features such as gene selection and denoising through two-step manifold fitting, 
clustering, visualization, differential gene identification and plotting, and multi-scale, high-resolution cellular atlas construction. 
Compared to traditional methods, CellScope excels across various single-cell datasets, significantly improving clustering accuracy, visualization clarity, and computational efficiency, while reducing hyperparameter dependency and enhancing algorithm interpretability.
