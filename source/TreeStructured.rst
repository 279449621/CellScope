TreeStructured: ``ts``
======================

Generation and visualization of tree-structured representations of cell clustering using UMAP and various steps.

.. list-table::

   * - ``CellScope.ts.find_map``
     - Create a mapping matrix between two sets of cluster labels.

   * - ``CellScope.ts.generate_tree_structured``
     - Generate the tree-structured representation of data based on clustering labels.

   * - ``CellScope.ts.visualize_tree_structured``
     - Visualize the tree-structured UMAP embeddings for different levels of clustering.
